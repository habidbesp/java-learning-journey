# Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Java Learning Journey** repository!  
This repository contains all the concepts and exercises I've worked on as I start learning Java. I will be updating it regularly as I cover new topics.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Here are the topics I've learned so far:

1. ###### **Introduction to Java**
   - Basic overview of Java and its structure.
   - First "Hello, World!" program.

2. ###### **Variables**
   - Understanding data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, etc.
   - Declaring and using variables.
   - How to assign values to variables.

3. ###### **Strings**
   - Introduction to `String` in Java.
   - Basic string operations: concatenation, length, and common methods.

4. ###### **Console Input and Output**
   - Reading user input using `Scanner`.
   - Printing output to the console with `System.out.println`.
   - Learned how to format strings in Java using methods like `String.format()` and `printf() to create well-structured outputs.

5. ###### **Random Number Generation**
   - Explored how to generate random numbers in Java using the Random class to create random integers for various purposes.

6. ###### Operators in Java
   - **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
   - **Unary Operators**: Pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, and post-decrement.
   - **Comparison Operators**:
      - Logical AND (`&&`)
      - Logical OR (`||`)
      - Logical NOT (`!`)
   - **VIP Discount System**: A program designed to demonstrate the use of the operators learned.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies

- **Java** (JDK 17+)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (my current IDE)
- **Git** (for version control)
